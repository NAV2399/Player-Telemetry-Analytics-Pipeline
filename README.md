# Player-Telemetry-Analytics-Pipeline

1. Introduction

This project demonstrates how to build an end-to-end data pipeline for handling real-time player telemetry data in the gaming domain.

Ingest player actions (login, sessions, purchases) in real time.

Process data using Kafka, Spark (Databricks), and Airflow.

Store data in Snowflake / Azure Synapse.

Build BI dashboards in Power BI/Tableau to track KPIs like Daily Active Users (DAU), churn, and engagement.

Pipeline Flow:
ðŸ‘‰ Player Events â†’ Kafka â†’ Databricks (PySpark) â†’ Snowflake (Data Warehouse) â†’ BI Dashboards

3. Tools & Technologies

Programming: Python, SQL, Spark (PySpark)

Big Data & Streaming: Kafka, Databricks, Hadoop, Airflow

Cloud & Warehousing: Azure, Snowflake

Databases: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, NoSQL

Visualization: Power BI, Tableau

4. Implementation Steps
Step 1: Data Ingestion

Used Kafka to stream player events in real time.

Sample events: {"player_id": 101, "action": "login", "timestamp": "2025-09-08 12:01:02"}.

Step 2: Data Processing

Processed with Databricks PySpark for cleaning & transformations.

Added session durations, purchase totals, churn flags.

Step 3: Data Storage

Stored curated data in Snowflake for analytics.

Created dimensional models: FactPlayerEvents, DimPlayer, DimGame.

Step 4: BI Dashboard

Built dashboards in Power BI/Tableau.

KPIs:

Daily Active Users (DAU)

Average Session Length

Player Retention Rate

In-Game Purchases by Region

5. Results

âœ… Real-time ingestion pipeline reduced latency from hours â†’ seconds.
âœ… Optimized schemas improved query performance by 30%.
âœ… BI dashboards gave business teams insights into player engagement & monetization.

6. Key Learnings

How to handle real-time event ingestion.

Importance of schema design & data quality checks.

Using Airflow for orchestration & reliability.

End-to-end integration from raw events â†’ curated insights.

7. Future Improvements

Add ML models for churn prediction.

Integrate Flink for ultra-low-latency processing.

Enable real-time alerts for abnormal player behavior.
